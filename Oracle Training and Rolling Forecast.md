### **Question**

> *"During model training, can we use actual future values of independent variables (relative to the prediction date) to improve forecasting, even though in real-world deployment, we won't have these future values?"*  

### **Short Answer**  
**Yes, but with caution.** This is a form of **"oracle training"** (training with perfect future knowledge), and it can be useful if:  
1. **You have a two-stage forecasting process** (first forecast future features, then use them to predict the target).  
2. **You want to isolate model performance** by assuming perfect future feature knowledge.  
3. **You are okay with some leakage in training**, as long as you ensure no leakage in deployment.  

However, **you must ensure no future data leaks into the test set** during evaluation.

### **When Is This Acceptable?**  
#### ✅ **Case 1: Forecasting Future Features First**  
- If your model pipeline is:  
  1. **Forecast future independent variables** (e.g., interest rates, borrower behavior).  
  2. **Use those forecasts to predict mortgage conversion.**  
- Then, in **training**, you can use **true future values of features** (instead of forecasts) to:  
  - Learn the **best possible relationship** between features and target.  
  - Later, replace true future values with forecasts in **deployment**.  

#### ✅ **Case 2: Oracle Training for Upper-Bound Performance**  
- Sometimes, we train with **perfect future knowledge** just to see:  
  - *"How good could the model be if we had perfect feature forecasts?"*  
  - This sets an **upper bound** on model performance.  

#### ✅ **Case 3: Encoder-Decoder Models (Seq2Seq, Transformer, TFT)**  
- Models like **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** allow you to:  
  - Encode past data.  
  - Decode future known inputs (e.g., scheduled rate changes).  
  - This is common in **time-series forecasting** where some future inputs are known (e.g., holidays).  

---

### **When Is This Dangerous?**  
#### ❌ **Case 1: Leakage in Test Set**  
- If you train **and evaluate** using future values, your test metrics will be **overly optimistic** (since real-world predictions won't have future data).  
- **Fix:** Use **rolling-origin evaluation**, where for each test prediction, you only use data available up to that point.  

#### ❌ **Case 2: Assuming Future Features Will Be Available**  
- If your model relies too much on future inputs, it may fail when deployed (where future inputs must be forecasted).  
- **Fix:** Train **both** with:  
  - **True future values** (to learn ideal relationships).  
  - **Forecasted future values** (to mimic real-world conditions).  

---

### **Best Approaches for Your Problem**  
1. **Train with Future Features (Oracle Mode)**  
   - Helps the model learn the **true relationship** between variables.  
   - Ensures no **model misspecification** due to poor feature forecasts.  

2. **Fine-Tune with Forecasted Features**  
   - Replace true future values with forecasts in later training stages.  
   - Makes the model **robust to forecast errors**.  

3. **Use Time-Series Models That Handle Known Future Inputs**  
   - **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**  
   - **Seq2Seq models with teacher forcing** (use true future inputs during training but not inference).  

---

### **Example Workflow**  
1. **Training Phase:**  
   - Use **actual future values** of features (e.g., rate locks, employment status) to predict conversion.  
   - This teaches the model the "correct" relationship.  

2. **Deployment Phase:**  
   - Replace future values with **forecasts** (or proxy estimates).  

3. **Evaluation Phase:**  
   - Test in a **realistic setting** (no future data in test predictions).  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- **Yes, you can train with future data**, but only if:  
  - You ensure no leakage in the test set.  
  - You acknowledge that **real-world predictions won't have perfect future knowledge**.  
- **Best for your use case:**  
  - **Train with true future values first** (to learn relationships).  
  - **Fine-tune with forecasted values** (to mimic deployment).  
  - **Use models like TFT** if some future inputs are known.  

### **Should You Predict One Period Ahead (Rolling Forecast) vs. Far Future?**  
Your idea of **predicting one period ahead and rolling forecasts forward** is a classic and robust approach, especially when future independent variables are uncertain. Let's compare the two strategies:

#### **Option 1: Direct Far-Future Forecasting**  
- **Pros:**  
  - Single prediction for the entire horizon (e.g., "Will this mortgage fund in 6 months?").  
  - Can capture long-term dependencies (e.g., rate lock expiration effects).  
- **Cons:**  
  - Requires forecasting future features (introducing error compounding).  
  - Harder to incorporate new information as it arrives.  
  - Risk of overconfidence if trained on "oracle" future data.  

#### **Option 2: Rolling 1-Step-Ahead Predictions**  
- **Pros:**  
  - **No need to forecast far-future features**—only the next step's features are needed.  
  - **Gradually incorporates new data** (e.g., if a borrower's credit score changes, the next prediction updates).  
  - **More robust** because errors don't compound as badly.  
  - **Easier to validate** (standard time-series backtesting).  
- **Cons:**  
  - **May miss long-term trends** (if the model is too short-sighted).  
  - **Computationally heavier** (requires repeated predictions).

### **When to Use Rolling 1-Step-Ahead Forecasts?**  
✅ **If future independent variables are uncertain** (e.g., interest rates, borrower behavior).  
✅ **If you can frequently update predictions** (e.g., daily/weekly refreshes).  
✅ **If short-term dynamics matter more than long-term trends.**  

### **When to Use Direct Far-Future Forecasting?**  
✅ **If some future inputs are known** (e.g., a fixed-rate lock expiration date).  
✅ **If long-term dependencies dominate** (e.g., seasonal housing demand).  
✅ **If you must provide a single long-term decision** (e.g., underwriting approval).

### **Hybrid Approach: Multi-Horizon Forecasting with Rolling Updates**  
A compromise is to:  
1. **Train a model to predict 1-step ahead.**  
2. **At deployment, roll predictions forward** (using new data as it arrives).  
3. **But also train an auxiliary model for long-term trends** (e.g., "probability of funding within 6 months").  

This gives you both **short-term adaptability** and **long-term insight**.

### **Recommendation for Your Mortgage Problem**  
Since mortgage conversions depend on **evolving borrower behavior, macroeconomic changes, and lender actions**, a **rolling 1-step-ahead approach is safer and more realistic**.  

#### **Implementation Steps:**  
1. **Train a model to predict:**  
   - *"Given data up to today, what's the probability of conversion in the next [time period]?"*  
2. **At deployment:**  
   - Predict next period.  
   - When new data arrives (e.g., borrower updates employment status), re-predict.  
3. **Aggregate rolling predictions** to estimate far-future outcomes.  

#### **Advanced Option:**  
- Use **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** or **Seq2Seq** models, which can:  
  - Handle known future inputs (e.g., rate lock end date).  
  - Adapt to new data in a rolling fashion.

### **Key Takeaway**  
- **For reliability and avoiding feature forecasting errors → Rolling 1-step-ahead is better.**  
- **For long-term planning & known future events → Direct far-future modeling may help.**  
- **Best of both worlds?** Combine a rolling model with a long-term trend model.
